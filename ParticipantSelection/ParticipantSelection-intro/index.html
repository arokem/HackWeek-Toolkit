    <h1 id="selecting-participants-for-hack-weeks">Selecting Participants for Hack Weeks</h1>
<p>All of our hack weeks have been oversubscribed by at least a factor of 2. This brings up an 
important question: who do we invite to the hack week, and who do we leave out? 
The interactive nature of a hack week necessitates a careful procedure for participant selection.
Selection committees will likely want to pick participants who are on board with and willing to 
advance the vision and values of the hack week model around collaboration and inclusivity.
It may be tempting and straightforward to select candidates that are known personally to the committee
as good citizens of the community, but we warn organizers that taking this approach might 
run counter several goals that a hack week might have: organizers should ask themselves how diverse 
their own networks are in practice. Do these networks contain predominantly researchers from 
privileged backgrounds and/or institutions? If so, they might want to consider strategies to broaden 
their reach and draw in researchers from outside of their networks.  </p>
<h2 id="general-notes-on-the-selection-strategy">General Notes on the Selection Strategy</h2>
<p>Participant selection is one of the most involved and fraught, but also often overlooked aspects 
of organizing a participant-driven workshop. Organizers should start the process <em>early</em>, ideally 
at the same time as the team formulates their goals for organizing the hack week: formulating a 
strategy for selecting participants <em>starts</em> with a formulation of the goals and
objectives of the workshop, along with the core values that organizers are aiming to implement and 
advance. From there, organizers may ask how participant selection might serve these goals and values. 
Possible goals are:
* teaching data science methods to a wide range of researchers in your domain
* encouraging collaborations between researchers of different fields
* encouraging collaborations between researchers in different stages of their careers
* improving access to modern methods and tools for researchers from underrepresented groups</p>
<p>These are just examples: the goals of your workshop will necessarily depend on the particular community
the hack week is embedded in and its needs. In the ideal case, the formulated goals lead to a 
clear strategy for selecting participants.
For example, a workshop that targets early-career researchers and is more teaching-oriented may wish 
to preferentially admit graduate students and postdocs, whereas a workshop aimed at collaboration across 
career stages may prefer to mix career stages more broadly.
In practice, however, it is often not trivial to match up workshop goals with specific choices to be 
made</p>
<p>Similarly, organizers should articulate a strategy for assessing whether candidates have the appropriate 
skill level and are likely to participate in a way that creates a welcoming community for the group 
as a whole. This is generally a hard problem: research from the hiring literature suggests that there 
is an irreducible variance when trying to predict future performance from applications and intervies 
(see e.g. <a href="">Highhouse, 2008</a>). This is also the place where unconscious biases are most likely to creep 
into the process. Our best advice is to think critically about the selection process, ensure that all 
committee members are aware of common unconscious biases and are reminded of them throughout the selection 
process, and to evaluate and re-evaluate every part of the selection process before, during and after 
each workshop. For all of our hack weeks, we have been continuously learning and aiming to improve 
each year, and we continue to incorporate our own observations and external feedback in our workshops.</p>
<h2 id="designing-and-assessing-application-forms">Designing and Assessing Application Forms</h2>
<p>Because our hack weeks are oversubscribed, we generally ask participants to <em>apply</em> using a form, and 
then go through an internal selection procedure to select participants from among the applicants. 
What information candidates are asked to provide during the application differs quite widely 
among the hack weeks, but for all hack weeks (and indeed all workshops), it is important to keep 
in mind that <strong>one can only use information for a selection that has been collected on the application 
form</strong>. This may seem obvious, but experience has taught us in several instances that omissions on 
the form led to serious difficulties in our selection later. Especially with questions that aim to 
probe values and traits such as collaborativeness, designing questions that elicit useful information 
about the trait in question is difficult, and on many occasions a question we thought would do so 
did not, in fact, provide us with useful information.</p>
<p>It is therefore worth the time and effort to design application forms carefully and intentionally.
In the process, especially for open-ended questions, organizers should interrogate their own 
expectations about how participants might answer, and their biases in the answers that are expected.
For example, a bias against non-native English speakers might lead reviewers to rate responses by
these candidates lower. Similarly, for questions around diversity and inclusion, it is worth considering 
how differences across cultures and countries might affect what terminology and concepts candidates 
may be familiar with. There may also be effects related to seniority and familiarity with 
university environments and culture: more senior participants, especially those from more privileged 
institutions, might have a better sense of what information organizers are trying to elicit, simply 
because they have had more training in responding to questions like those likely asked on hack week 
application forms, and because they have been embedded in the particular culture of academic departments. </p>
<p>While many of the hack weeks use Google Forms for application forms, it is worth critically 
examining that choice on the basis of respondent privacy and data rights, especially when 
forms may ask for sensitive demographic information.</p>
<h3 id="assessing-qualifications">Assessing Qualifications</h3>
<p>Some hack weeks have requirements about the proficiency with programming or tools that participants 
are expected to have at the start of the hack week. Proficiency could be assessed, as in admission 
contexts, through university transcripts. However, grades do not necessarily reflect proficiency, 
and the grading systems employed in different countries may make an assessment difficult. 
Organizers could also simply <em>ask</em> participants whether they believe themselves to be at a certain 
skill levels, e.g. whether they are beginners, intermediate users or experts. Because there is no 
objective scale for what an "expert programmer" might be, and different people might give different 
answers to that question, assessing proficiency that way may lead to biases in the selection.</p>
<p>In the hack weeks, we generally aim to assess proficiency with questions that tie skills to 
particular milestone achievements. For example, when asking about proficiency with machine learning, 
we might ask participants whether they've only encountered machine learning in their course work, 
whether they have used a machine learning algorithm for a research project, or whether they have 
developed and implemented machine learning algorithms themselves. One goal here is to make the 
questions as clear and unambiguous as possible. 
However, even here biases may affect the selection. In particular, participants from institutions or 
countries that are less well-resources may be less likely to have encountered computational classes 
or trainings in their home institutions. As a result, they may be less likely to be proficient 
programmers, and simply selecting on coding ability may select out these participants. 
We suggest that organizers view these questions in the larger context and take the opportunities that 
a particular applicant may or may not have had into account during the selection process.</p>
<h3 id="assessing-core-values">Assessing Core Values</h3>
<p>Hack weeks thrive through participants who are enthusiastic, curious, collaborative and kind to others. 
Assessing these traits is perhaps the most difficult part of any selection procedure. In addition, 
some hack weeks have asked questions around the contributions that participants are likely to make, 
and about the impact that someone's participation might have on their local community. Our hack weeks 
have assessed these values and traits through a range of different methods, including open-ended 
questions on the application form, personal statements and recommendation letters.
As mentioned above, questions should be phrased thoughtfully and intentionally with the goal of 
minimizing biases during this stage.
Following best practices from the hiring literature (e.g. <a href="">Bohnet, 2015</a>), these responses, letters 
or statements should be graded by several reviewers, using a clear, unambiguous set of rubrics that have 
been vetted carefully to minimize biases. Some hack weeks have performed this grading using a blinded 
set, where the names and demographics of the applicants were hidden from the raters. Other hack weeks 
have instead taken other information, for example career stage, home institution and demographic information
into account at this stage in order to mediate effects that may systematically disadvantage some candidates.
Based on our current knowledge as organizers, there is no single best way to do this: while there are 
well-documented effects that indicate that certain candidates may be disadvantaged based on their name 
alone in hiring contexts (STUDY), some research also shows that committees that are careful about taking
systematic effects and biases into account tend to do <em>worse</em> when demographic information about 
the candidates is removed (ALSO STUDY). </p>
<p>Once all applications have been rated, the members of the organizing committee might then 
take the ratings and carefully examine them for biases. For example, one may look at interrate reliability 
to see whether specific raters tend to only give grades in a certain subset of the available ratings. 
One may also look at whether certain groups (for example junior academics) are systematically rated worse, 
indicating that biases have not been fully eliminated during earlier stages of the process. Data visualizations 
are enormously helpful here, as is a practice of multiple organizers taking an independent look at the 
ratings generated by the reviewers.</p>
<h3 id="questions-about-the-participants-background">Questions about the Participant's Background</h3>
<p>For all hack weeks, considerable thought and discussion goes into which information to elicit regarding 
the applicants' backgrounds. This includes for example their current institution, academic field of study 
and/or research, and career stage, but also questions around gender identity, sexual orientation and race and ethnicity.
In particular sensitive questions around one's identity are difficult to phrase and incorporate in selection 
procedures. Organizers may decide to simply not include them. However, if the pool of applicants is biased 
with respect to those categories, organizers risk that the workshop itself may reproduce those biases, or 
exacerbate them if other categories of assessment (for example open-ended answers) correlate with demographic 
categories. </p>
<p>There are different ways many of these questions can be phrased, and different ways that information 
can be included in a participant selection strategy. Questions related to demographic background should 
always be voluntary, and non-disclosure should not negatively affect someone's likelihood of being 
accepted. Workshops that are globally advertised may run into difficulties with phrasing questions 
around race and ethnicity, where categories may be defined differently in different countries. Hack weeks have 
generally done one of two things: either follow US-based categorization of race and ethnicity, or formulate 
a question that asked whether someone considered themselves a minority with respect to race and ethnicity 
in their field of study. The former will allow for a more fine-grained selection process that takes 
into account how different groups experience different kinds of oppression and privilege, but they may also require 
applicants, especially those that do not identify with the US-based categorization, into a system that 
does not correspond to their lived reality. The latter approach side-steps those cross-cultural issues, 
but combines all participant into minority and non-minority categories, which may disproportionally 
disadvantage some groups. In addition, recent feedback suggests that phrasing the question this way 
might induce stereotype threat in our applicants, and thus some hack weeks are moving away from that approach.
One potential solution might be to move away from an approach of categorization for demographic categories
(including for example also gender identity) and simply allow applicants to self-identify using a free-form response.</p>
<p>How should these categories---professional categories like someone's career stage or institution, and 
demographic ones like gender identity and race and ethnicity---be included in the selection process?
As mentioned above, they could be part of a selection where individual candidates are considered on the 
bases of their responses as well as the information disclosed in this section of the application form
(if it was disclosed). Career stage, location and demographic categories could in this scenario inform 
selection by providing information about the applicant's opportunities, and the privilege or oppression
they may have experienced in the field.</p>
<p>Some of the hack weeks, motivated by the idea of diversifying the workshop across many of these 
categories, have used a selection process mediated by an algorithm (implemented in the software 
<a href="">Entrofy</a>) to support the selection. In this approach, the committee will generally perform 
some pre-selection based on the open-ended answers, personal statements and recommendation letters
to identify a subset of qualified candidates. 
The final cohort is selected using the algorithm, where the objective is to have the cohort 
globally match a set of target values across all categories. Astro Hack Week and Geo Hack Week have 
both implemented procedures that followed this model. It is worth nothing here that <strong>the use 
of an algorithm does not make the selection intrinsically less biased</strong>. Categories, the allowed 
values within each category, and the target values are all chosen by humans, most likely the organizers, 
and are thus subject to the biases these humans impose during creation of the application form or 
the subsequent selection on open-ended answers. As Meredith Broussard states in her book 
<a href="">"Artificial Unintelligence"</a>, algorithms are social constructs, because they are constructed by humans.
Using algorithmic mediation in selection processes does not absolve organizers of critical 
interrogation of their procedures and the biases they might impose on it, however unintentionally. </p>
<p>One advantage of the approach employing Entrofy is that it allows for more straightforward transparency and 
accountability than more traditional approaches might. Organizers can (and do so in practice) share 
the details of the selection procedure, categories and targets used, and often the code employed for 
selection (after removal of all confidential participant data). However, the structure of the algorithm 
requires that applicants can fit themselves into pre-defined categories, which may be difficult given the
aforementioned problems when categories are intrinsically ill-defined or not inclusive. </p>
<p>The hack weeks are continuously iterating and changing our approach with the aim to make our selection 
procedures more equitable and fair, and we share information and experiences among one another to learn 
from our different events. However, none of us feel that we have a single set of best practices to share 
that would guarantee and equitable selection. Our best advice is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be critical of your selection procedures, and continuously evaluate, solicit feedback and continue learning around the issues that make selection difficult and fraught with biases</li>
<li>Educate yourself on the biases that typically appear in selection procedures: the branch of industrial and organization psychology has both in-depth scientific works as well as popular science-level introductions to offer that may be helpful, and more and more organizations share their hiring procedures and their thinking around how to approach difficult issues within hiring.</li>
<li>Be as transparent and accountable as possible. Admitting participants for an oversubscribed workshop necessarily means that others will be turned away. In a space like academia where rejection is relatively common, receiving that notice from a workshop might lead to self-doubt. It is always useful to share the thinking behind the selection, the procedures and the general outcomes. In addition, as organizing committees we are aware that our knowledge around issues of equity and inclusion is incomplete and fraught with our own biases that we bring into this space. Transparency enables critical feedback from the community, which in turn enables improvement</li>
<li>Protect your participants' data. During the application process, participants may share sensitive data with the organizers, who are therefore obliged to keep that information confidential and protected from exploitation through internal or outside actors. </li>
</ul>
