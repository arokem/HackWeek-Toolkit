    <h1 id="objectives-and-goals-of-a-hack-week">Objectives and Goals of a Hack Week</h1>
<p>Key to the hack week organization process--and perhaps the process of organizing any meeting---is 
a clear understanding what the hack week is <em>for</em>. What goals and objectives are the organizers 
pursuing by organizing this hack week? Are these goals <em>personal</em> goals or <em>community-level</em> goals? 
Some community-level goals might include bringing more data science methods into the community, 
building a cohort of like-minded researchers, making progress on a specific tool, software package 
or data set, and building a set of tools to address one specific or multiple scientific challenges. </p>
<p>Our hack weeks are very non-uniform in their goals and objectives. For example, Astro Hack Week 
pitches itself as widely as possible: while the focus of the tutorials is often on new methods and 
tools, any broadly astronomy-themed hack is welcome. This could include developing new software, but 
could also mean providing a document of resources for teaching, designing a new logo for an organization, 
or building tutorials for computational and astronomy subjects. Geo Hack Week, in contrast is more narrow 
in scope and focuses on improving computational and programming literacy in the Geosciences community, and 
on working directly on software tools that address geophysical challenges. The IceSat-2 Hack Week is 
even more narrowly scoped on developing next-generation tools for a new space mission. </p>
<p>It is worth pointing out explicitly that none of those is better than the other. They are designed 
differently to solve different challenges in different communities, and the hack week model easily 
accomodates different goals that the organizers might pursue. In any of these cases, however, it is 
important to be clear among the organizers what those goals and objectives actually are, and perhaps 
spell them out, for example in a mission statement. They form the basis of much of the subsequent 
organization, ranging from questions of whether participants require pre-knowledge during participant 
selection to facilitating the hacks themselves.</p>
<p>Ideally, an organizing committee should start with the question: <em>What are we trying to achieve?</em>
From there, one can write down a set of big-picture themes that provide the basis for more specific 
goals, as well as actions that help achieve those goals. 
In this context, it is also helpful for organizers to discuss and settle on a set of <em>core values</em> that 
the organizers aim to follow in their organization of the workshop. 
These values will align with the overall mission of hack weeks and will represent the specific 
dimensions of that mission that the organizers wish to amplify, and could include values like kindness, 
collaborativeness, and attentiveness, to name a few. The values defined in this stage might in part form 
the basis for developing the code of conduct, and are helpful when framing facilitation strategies.</p>
<p>Some hackathons have also experienced with <em>user stories</em> in order to build a narrative around goals 
and objectives, and to identify problems and barriers for participants in achieving those goals.
User stories in this context are short narratives centred around hypothetical participants, and describe 
for example what such a participant might tell their colleague or supervisor after the event. 
Our hack weeks have never implemented this approach, but some are considering it for future iterations.</p>
<p>For Astro Hack Week, the goals generally include:</p>
<ul>
<li>improve the data science literacy within the astronomy community</li>
<li>build a cohort of like-minded researchers and allow them to build a community</li>
<li>improve the representation of researchers from minority backgrounds within the astronomy and data science communities</li>
<li>promote best practices related to open science and reproducibility within the astronomy community</li>
<li>help researchers build open-source software</li>
<li>allow researchers to formulate, implement and rapidly test new ideas</li>
<li>allow researchers to have fun with projects they care about, but that often are not part of their day-to-day work</li>
<li>provide a venue for work that directly helps the astronomy community as a whole</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="target-audience-and-scoping-to-specific-communities">Target Audience and Scoping to Specific Communities</h2>
<p>Most directly related to the goals and objectives is the question of who the target audience for the 
workshop is. In our experience, the question of what the goals and objectives are arises naturally 
during the selection process of participants. In order to understand what a cohort matched to the 
goals and objectives of the workshop looks like, one first must understand what those goals <em>are</em>. 
With broadly scoped workshops like Astro Hack Week or Geo Hack Week, one might start from those goals 
and objectives and then ask what the target audience for these goals is. For example, a workshop that 
is very heavily focused on software development might wish to set minimum requirements for coding ability 
at the onset (though one important consideration in this process should be if the target audience as defined might 
systematically disadvantage candidate from specific backgrounds).</p>
<p>Some organizers might wish to follow this process the other way around: perhaps the organizers have a very 
specific audience in mind that they wish to serve, and then work to identify specific needs of that community 
in order to set goals and expectations for the workshop. For example, the IceSat-2 hack week was centred around 
the community expected to take advantage of the new data sets this mission creates. The organizers identified 
a lack of openly available tools to this end, and designed the hack week specifically to provide a venue to 
start projects around the creation of those tools. </p>
<p>In practice, setting goals and defining a target audience are interlinked. Even committees approaching the 
problem from the goals perspective will often have identified a persistent need in the target audience first, 
that they feel they can start addressing by organizing the workshop.</p>
<p>While many of the objectives for Astro Hack Week are related to data science and its place within the 
astronomy community, the target audience is intentionally kept broad, and includes researchers from both 
astronomy and other research fields, academia and industry, early-career and senior researchers. The 
guiding principle is that great ideas and innovation may come from anywhere, and that these ideas may 
or may not involve code or data science. Astro Hack Week strives to provide a venue for many types of 
ideas and projects, and thus imposes very few requirements on potential participants.</p>
<h2 id="advertising">Advertising</h2>
<p>Once you have defined your workshop goals, and identified a target audience, how do you reach that target 
audience in practice? A website is a useful tool to convey information about the workshop, as are announcements 
via e-mail or social media. Crafting both the website and announcements carefully is important here: the 
announcement should be clear about the goals and objectives, but also share the <em>values</em> of the workshop and 
the community and environment that the organizers strive to create. Often researchers will read announcements 
and websites quite closely to figure out whether the event aligns with their interests and values. 
Especially because hackathons as events have negative connotations with some groups of people, communicating 
the community-focused and collaborative nature of the hack weeks is important to reach researchers who might 
otherwise feel discouraged from applying.
It should be obvious, but is worth pointing out explicitly, that an event should only be advertised as inclusive 
if the organizers are committed and are taking active steps to make the event inclusive. Asking researchers to 
spend their valuable time, money and effort to attend a workshop that in practice might be exclusionary to them 
or actively harmful to their well-being and/or careers should not ever happen.</p>
<p>In practical terms, like with other conferences, we largely rely on traditional channels 
of sharing conference announcements: personal networks, professional societies and social media like Twitter.
Because Astro Hack Week also has a mandate of improving the participation of minority researchers in data 
science research in astronomy, we also reach out to community groups that serve these researchers. </p>
