    <h1 id="past-and-potential-venues-for-hosting-hack-weeks">Past and Potential Venues for Hosting Hack Weeks</h1>
<p>Hack weeks can and have been hosted at universities, for example in university library 
spaces or active classrooms. There is also a growing number of venues that facilitate 
organization of scientific conferences (and especially discussion meetings) that are 
great venues for hack weeks (and often come with the benefit of some administrative 
support).</p>
<p>This document compiles a list of venues where hack weeks have been hosted in the past,
or that we think might potentially be good venues. Note that many of these require 
an application &gt;12-18 months in advance of the workshop!</p>
<p>If you have additional venues in mind that might make great venues for hack 
weeks (either specific to a scientific field or a specific geographic region), 
please share your suggestion with us through <a href="https://github.com/uwescience/HackWeek-Toolkit/issues">the issues</a>.
Because organizing events in the US and EU countries can present significant obstacles to 
participants from some countries (both in terms of travel and in terms of acquiring travel 
visas), we are particularly curious about potential venues in Africa, Asia and Australia. </p>
<h2 id="lorentz-center-leiden">Lorentz Center Leiden</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lorentzcenter.nl">Lorentz Center</a> is a venue for organizing interactive 
workshops, run by the University of Leiden and the Dutch funding agency NWO. Leiden is a 
half hour by train from the Amsterdam Airport, which is a major European air travel hub. 
The Netherlands have a dense system of public transport (mostly train and bus), which also 
connects internationally to Belgium, France, Germany and the UK. The Netherlands are a 
relatively tolerant and open culture, with high levels of English language fluency in the 
cities. 
The Lorentz Center itself provides rooms, monetary funding and significant administrative 
help with organizing the workshop. The Center provides a room that fits of the order of 
50 participants, and while not fully configurable (there are rules about fire safety), 
tables and chairs can be moved around and adjusted. On the same hallway is also a set of 
offices, and each participant is assigned a desk in a shared office for the duration of 
the workshop. Participants used these offices for focused project work as well as break-out 
sessions. 
The Lorentz Center requires an application ~12-18 months in advance of the workshop and is 
available for workshops across the natural sciences, computational sciences as well as the 
humanities and social sciences. While
it is not stricly necessary to have a researcher based in the Netherlands on the organizing 
committee, one mandate of the Center is for workshops to engage the Dutch research community, 
where inclusion of a researcher based at a Dutch institution can be helpful. 
The Center provides several thousand Euros worth of funding for each accepted workshop, in 
addition to the rooms, coffee breaks, administrative support, and a conference dinner. 
They also provide lunches and access to bicycles at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>We organized Astro Hack Week 2018 at the Lorentz Center, and had very positive experiences 
with the Center. The staff are extremely professional and well-organized, which reduced the 
burden on us as a committee significantly. They worked closely with us and were flexible enough 
to accommodate some of our particular requests, such as our application + registration procedure. 
Many of the practices administrative matters, like hotel block bookings, caterings and buses for 
the conference dinner, were organized without us having to think about them in detail, which was 
extremely helpful. The two weaknesses we identified were the lack of air conditioning and the 
difficulty to arrange a live-stream and recording for our tutorials. Astro Hack Week coincided 
with a major heat wave, which made it hard for participants to concentrate on occasion. 
The Lorentz Center is also technically not set up for live streaming, and bringing in our own 
equipment came with some challenges (most notably, the variable upload data rates).</p>
