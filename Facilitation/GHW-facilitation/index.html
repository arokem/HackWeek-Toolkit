Express gratitude to:
    <ul>
        <li>participants for joining us, taking a full week out of their busy schedules
        funding agencies who support all of this happening
        <li> the organizing team for dedication to our mission and hard work to develop content
    </ul>

Before we get started, some initial logistics
    <ul>
        <li> we officially cannot bring any food or drink into this room
        <li> Coffee breaks each day at 10 am and 3 pm
        <li> Lunch
        <li> Bathrooms: just outside to the right
        <li> After hours: building locks at 7 pm
        <li> Tutorials are being recorded
        <li> Happy hour this evening
    </ul>

You might be wondering, what is a hackweek? Some brief history:
    <ul>
        <li> Hackweeks were designed 5 years ago at eScience
        <li> The idea was to blend teaching with open project time
        <li> Review our overall mission common across all hackweeks
        <li> We can realize our mission only when we create the conditions for a positive learning environment
        <li> As an organizing committee, it  is our responsibility to create and sustain this environment so that each of you can do whatever learning you need to do this week
        <li> Next we will discuss our shared principles and code of conduct that are the foundation of creating this learning community
    </ul>

    <td>Presentation</td>

    <ul>
        <li> As we transition into our first tutorial, let’s return to one of the core missions of our hackweek: peer learning
        <li> One very unique component of hackweeks is that we intentionally maximize diversity in who we accept to the program. That includes disciplinary diversity. Folks in this room come from a wide variety of fields, each with their own technological tools and vocabularies.
        <li> Therefore,everyone approaches these tutorials with their own particular combination of disciplinary and data science knowledge. Material could be overwhelmingly new, or in some cases you may have already mastered it in your own training. Most people will reside somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. 
        <li> We therefore encourage you to help each other along in your learning journey. If you already have some material mastered, this could be an opportunity for you to teach others in the room who may not have encountered this material yet.
